## My Solution

## The Challenge

The Challenge was to recreate the given desktop and mobile designs as close as possible. The design also had active states as well.

The important part was that the design should be responsive and accessible for all users and devices.

Reference Designs:

## Goals

- Write Clean, Readable CSS.
  - Comment my CSS.
- Really focusing on responsiveness and making sure that the design looks good across all screens.
  - Use min(), max() and clamp() properties for setting widths and font sizes.
  - Use media queries
  - Focus on intention behind setting properties like widths. To try and really understand what the property is doing before setting it. Being in control of what's going on and not getting lost.
- Using Flexbox and Grid smartly.
- Writing Accessible Code.
- Documenting my experience and learning.

## What I learnt

Took much longer than I expected. It looked simple but was actually pretty tricky. The background images were difficult to deal with and the responsive design aspect of the challenge is what surprised me.

I would really like some feedback on this challenge (especially on the responsiveness), because it was quite an undertaking and I implemented some new stuff I learnt. Also tried commenting my code and I think it is quite clean as well.

First attempt went pretty badly, so I did some research about using min( ) max ( ) and clamp ( ) for widths and font-sizes. I used them in my second attempt and refactored all my CSS code. I was more methodical and intentional in writing my CSS this time, and It went much better. I still feel like I got lost towards the end, applying widths here and there to make things work, but much better than my previous attempts.

I feel like I understand responsive layouts and fluid design better now, but I am still not quite there yet. I am hoping to keep learning about these concepts. Whenever there are many components, I get lost and have trouble understanding how all the components are resizing. Switching from mobile to desktop designs using Media Queries is really tough in complex designs. I have to keep track of all the properties I set in the mobile design and have to reset in the desktop design. There might be a solution for this, like a tool, but I want to master Vanilla CSS.

[Kevin Powell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo) was really helpful and taught me about min() max() and clamp() properties.
